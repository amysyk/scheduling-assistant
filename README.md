# Scheduling Digital Assistant

Simplify managing your children's after-school activities with an intelligent digital assistant that consolidates schedules from multiple sources. Parents with kids in sports know the challenge of tracking scattered schedules across various apps, calendars, websites, and emails. A better way to do it is to let an LLM-based digital assistant read all the structured and unstructured data and tell you when and where kids need to be in plain English.
With the assistant you can:

* Aggregate schedules from different platforms
* Synthesize structured and unstructured scheduling data
* Provide clear, easy-to-understand activity summaries in plain English
* Make easy-to-understand summaries available to your extended family

The assistant has three components: a Streamlit chat app, an integration between the app and Anthropic LLM, and a system prompt that contains all scheduling data and instructions on how to synthesize it.
