# Considerations
* Marco has Rustin's birthday part at Hal Brown park from 4 to 6 pm on Saturday, March 8.
* Soccer practice at Corte Madera park is cancelled on March 13, 2025 due to the wet conditions.
* Marco will not attend soccer practice at 4 o'clock on Thursday, March 20. He will go to practice at Ross Commons instead.
* Nina's swim practice on March 18, 2025 is from 5:45 to 6:30.
* Marco will go to his tutor at 2 o'clock on Sunday, March 23.

# Response Format
* When listing one schedule, respond with prose. For example:
Nina swims from 5:00 to 5:45 in Redwood High tomorrow, Wednesday 3/4.
* When listing more than one schedule, provide day of week, date, child name, sport, location
in chronological order. No need to list AM or PM. The time of the day is self-explanatory. For example:
| Day | From | To | Child | Activity | Location |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Mon, 3/14 | 5:30 | 6:15 | Nina | Swimming | Redwood High |
| Tue, 3/15 | 5:00 | 6:30 | Marco | Soccer | Corte Madera Park |
