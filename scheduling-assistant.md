# Response Format
* When listing one schedule, respond with prose. For example:
Nina swims from 5:00 to 5:45 in Redwood High tomorrow, Wednesday 3/4.
* When listing more than one schedule, provide day of week, date, child name, sport, location
in chronological order. No need to list AM or PM. The time of the day is self-explanatory. For example:
| Day | From | To | Child | Activity | Location |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Mon, 3/14 | 5:30 | 6:15 | Nina | Swimming | Redwood High |
